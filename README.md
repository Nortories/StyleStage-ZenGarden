# Zen Garden: Haunted House Edition

Welcome to my unique take on the Style Stage challenge - a haunted house where your cursor turns into a flashlight, revealing hidden details in various rooms. This creative endeavor showcases the capabilities of CSS and Sass, pushing the boundaries of what's possible without altering the HTML structure or resorting to JavaScript.

## The Challenge

My theme, a haunted house, leverages advanced CSS and Sass techniques to create a dynamic, spooky atmosphere where users can "shine a light" on eerie secrets hidden within.
